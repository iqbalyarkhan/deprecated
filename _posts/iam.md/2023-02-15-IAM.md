## Intro

When you sign up for AWS using your email and password, you're assigned a user called the `root` user. This user has unrestricted access to all resources in that account. If this account gets hacked, this account will be at the mercy of the hacker. The root user cannot be restricted. We want to be able to provide access to others that isn't without restrictions: for example, the BI department might need access to AWS QuickSight but not to AWS S3. This process of providing only required access is called Least Privileged Access. This is where IAM comes handy!

## [IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)

IAM:

- Is a global service that is globally resilient service. All data is replicated across all regions
- Manages identities since it is an identity provider or **IDP**
- Provides **authentication** (who is signed in?): I am who I say I am!
- Provides **authorization** (who has permissions?) for AWS services. A service evaluates if an AWS request is allowed or denied. Access is denied by default and is allowed only when a policy explicitly grants access.

## IAM Entities

Using IAM, you can create IAM Users, IAM Groups and IAM Roles. Each have their own specific use-case:

### IAM Users

The "identity" aspect of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps you with the question "Who is that user?", often referred to as authentication. Users are identities which represent humans that need access to your account. IAM users are not separate accounts; they are users within your account. Each user can have its own password for access to the AWS Management Console.

IAM users are granted long term credentials to your AWS resources. As a best practice, you should require your human users to use temporary credentials when accessing AWS. You can use an identity provider for your human users to provide federated access to AWS accounts by assuming roles, which provide temporary credentials.

### IAM Groups

Groups are simply collections of related users. This is useful when you need to provide access to users who have similar roles in an org. For example, QuickSight access for all BAs in your BI group.

### IAM Roles

Roles help us provide permissions to:

- AWS services to perform actions on our behalf. For example lambda in our account writing to S3 bucket in our account.
- External services to our account. For example lambda in another account writing to S3 bucket in our account.

### Best Practice

As a [best practice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html), require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials. An additional best practice recommendation is to require workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access AWS. IAM users are to be used only in very limited scenarios where an IAM role cannot be assumed.

## IAM Policies

How does IAM actually "attach" these permissions to the entities listed above? That's where IAM policies come into picture. Policies are JSON documents that define deny or allow rights. On its own, a policy document does nothing. Only when it is attached to an entity does it take affect.
