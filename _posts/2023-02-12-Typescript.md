## Intro

Typescript is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.

## Compiler

Let's start at the compiler: programs are files that contain a bunch of text written by you, the programmer. That text is parsed by a special program called a compiler, which trans‐ forms it into an abstract syntax tree (AST), a data structure that ignores things like whitespace, comments, and where you stand on the tabs versus spaces debate. After the TypeScript Compiler generates an AST for your program—but before it emits code—it typechecks your code. The compiler then converts that AST to a lower-level representation called bytecode. You can feed that bytecode into another program called a runtime to evaluate it and get a result. So when you run a program, what you’re really doing is telling the runtime to evaluate the bytecode generated by the compiler from the AST parsed from your source code.

Where TypeScript is special is that instead of compiling straight to bytecode, TS compiles to JavaScript code. You then run that JavaScript code like you normally would—in your browser, or with NodeJS.

This typechecking is the magic behind TypeScript. It’s how TypeScript makes sure that your program works as you expect, that there aren’t obvious mistakes.

## The Type System

To explicitly signal to TypeScript what your types are, use annotations. Annotations take the form value: type and tell the typechecker, “Hey! You see this value here? Its type is type.” Let’s look at a few examples (the comments following each line are the actual types inferred by TypeScript):

```ts
let a: number = 1; // a is a number
let b: string = 'hello'; // b is a string
let c: boolean[] = [true, false]; // c is an array of booleans
```

And if you want TypeScript to infer your types for you, just leave them off and let TypeScript get to work:

```ts
let a = 1; // a is a number
let b = 'hello'; // b is a string
let c = [true, false]; // c is an array of booleans
```

TypeScript is a gradually typed language. That means that TypeScript works best when it knows the types of everything in your program at compile time, but it doesn’t have to know every type in order to compile your program. Even in an untyped pro‐ gram TypeScript can infer some types for you and catch some mistakes, but without knowing the types for everything, it will let a lot of mistakes slip through to your users. TypeScript statically analyzes your code for errors, and shows them to you before you run it.

## tsconfig.json

Every TypeScript project should include a file called tsconfig.json in its root directory. This tsconfig.json is where TypeScript projects define things like which files should be compiled, which directory to compile them to, and which version of JavaScript to emit.

```ts
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    //Which APIs should TSC assume exist in the environment you’ll be running your code in? This includes things like ES5’sFunction.prototype.bind, ES2015’sObject.assign, and the DOM’s document.querySelector.
    "lib": ["es2015"],
    // Which module system should TSC compile your code to (CommonJS, SystemJS, ES2015, etc.)?
    "module": "commonjs",
    // Which folder should TSC put your generated JavaScript code in?
    "outDir": "dist",
    "sourceMap": true,
    //Be as strict as possible when checking for invalid code. This option enforces that all of your code is properly typed. We’ll be using it for all of the examples in the book, and you should use it for your TypeScript project too.
    "strict": true,
    //Which JavaScript version should TSC compile your code to (ES3, ES5, ES2015, ES2016, etc.)?
    "target": "es2015"
  },
  //# Which folders should TSC look in to find your TypeScript files?
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

## tslint.json

Your project should also have a tslint.json file containing your TSLint configuration, codifying whatever stylistic conventions you want for your code (tabs versus spaces, etc.).

The following command will generate a tslint.json file with a default TSLint configuration:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/tslint --init
```

You can then add overrides to this to conform with your own coding style. For example, my tslint.json looks like this:

```ts
{
  "defaultSeverity": "error",
  "extends": [
      "tslint:recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "semicolon": false,
    "trailing-comma": false
  }
}
```

## Component

Let's look at our first react component:

```ts
import React from 'react';
function App() {
  //Do something
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

First, this React component, called `App` component, is just a JavaScript function. It’s commonly called function component, because there are other variations of React components.

Second, the App component doesn’t receive any parameters in its function signature yet. And third, the App component returns code that resembles HTML which is called JSX. The function component possess implementation details like any other JavaScript function (placeholder above is the //Do something comment).

Variables defined in the function’s body will be re-defined each time this function runs, like all JavaScript functions:

```ts
import React from 'react';
function App() {
  const title = 'React';
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello World, this is ${title}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

The `title` variable can also be define outside the function. Running the above would print `Hello World, this is React`.

Let's look at some more elements. An input field with a label can be defined as follows:

```ts
import React from 'react';
const title = 'React';
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello {title}</h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

We specified three HTML attributes here: htmlFor, id, and type. Where id and type should be familiar from native HTML, htmlFor might be new. The htmlFor reflects the for attribute in HTML. JSX replaces a handful of internal HTML attributes, but you can find all the supported HTML attributes33 in React’s documentation, which follow the camelCase naming convention.

Let's modify our greeting a little:

```ts
import React from 'react';

const welcome = {
  greeting: 'hey',
  title: 'React',
};

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>
        {welcome.greeting} {welcome.title}
      </h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

We can also call functions from within the curly braces:

```ts
import React from 'react';

function getGreeting() {
  return 'hey React!';
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{getGreeting()}</h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

## Lists in React

So far we’ve rendered a few primitive variables in JSX; next we’ll render a list of items. We’ll experiment with sample data at first, then we’ll apply that to fetch data from a remote API. First, let’s define the array as a variable. As before, we can define a variable outside or inside the component. The following defines it outside:

```ts

const list = [
  {
    title: 'React',
    url: 'https://reactjs.org/',
    author: 'Jordan Walke',
    num_comments: 3,
    points: 4,
    objectID: 0,
  },
  {
    title: 'Redux',
    url: 'https://redux.js.org/',
    author: 'Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark',
    num_comments: 2,
    points: 5,
    objectID: 1,
  },
];
function App() {...}
export default App;
```

Each item in the list has a title, a url, an author, an identifier (objectID), points – which indicate the popularity of an item – and a count of comments. Next, we’ll render the list within our JSX dynamically:

```ts
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Hacker Stories</h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
      <hr />
      {/* render the list here */}
    </div>
  );
}
```

By assigning a key attribute to each list item’s element, React can identify modified items if the list changes (e.g. re-ordering). Fortunately, our list items come with an identifier:

```ts
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      {' '}
      ...
      <hr />
      {list.map(function (item) {
        return <div key={item.objectID}>{item.title}</div>;
      })}{' '}
    </div>
  );
}
```

Note that we're using `item.ObjectID` as the `key` in our list. We avoid using the index of the item in the array to make sure the key attribute is a stable identifier. If the list changes its order, for example, React will not be able to identify the items properly. Here's what our code looks like right now:

```ts
import React from 'react';

const list = [
  {
    title: 'React',
    url: 'https://reactjs.org/',
    author: 'Jordan Walke',
    num_comments: 3,
    points: 4,
    objectID: 0,
  },
  {
    title: 'Redux',
    url: 'https://redux.js.org/',
    author: 'Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark',
    num_comments: 2,
    points: 5,
    objectID: 1,
  },
];

function getGreeting() {
  return 'hey React!';
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{getGreeting()}</h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
      <hr />
      {list.map(function (item) {
        return <div key={item.objectID}>{item.title}</div>;
      })}{' '}
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

We can display multiple fields from our list instead of just the title like so:

```ts
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{getGreeting()}</h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
      <hr />
      {list.map(function (item) {
        return (
          <div key={item.objectID}>
            <span>
              <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
            </span>{' '}
            written by {item.author}
          </div>
        );
      })}{' '}
    </div>
  );
}
```

The component above is getting too complicated, let's create a new list component on its own. To do so, I'll export the list to its own file called `list.ts`. This is what our App component looks like:

```ts
import { List } from './List';

function getGreeting() {
  return 'hey React!';
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{getGreeting()}</h1>
      <label htmlFor="search">Search: </label>
      <input id="search" type="text" />
      <hr />
      <List />
    </div>
  );
}
export default App;
```

Notice we're importing `List` from a separate file:

```ts
const list = [
  {
    title: 'React',
    url: 'https://reactjs.org/',
    author: 'Jordan Walke',
    num_comments: 3,
    points: 4,
    objectID: 0,
  },
  {
    title: 'Redux',
    url: 'https://redux.js.org/',
    author: 'Dan Abramov, Andrew Clark',
    num_comments: 2,
    points: 5,
    objectID: 1,
  },
];

export function List() {
  return (
    <div>
      {list.map(function (item) {
        return (
          <div key={item.objectID}>
            <span>
              <a href={item.url}>{item.title}</a>
            </span>{' '}
            written by {item.author}
          </div>
        );
      })}{' '}
    </div>
  );
}
```

With this example, we can see how components that encapsulate meaningful tasks can work for larger React applications.Larger React applications have component hierarchies (also called component trees). There is usually one uppermost entry point component (e.g. App) that spans a tree of components below it. The App is the parent component of the List, so the List is a child component of the App. In a component tree, the App is the root component, and the components that don’t render any other components are called leaf components (e.g. List). The App can have multiple children, as can the List. If the App has another child component, the additional child component is called a sibling component of the List.
