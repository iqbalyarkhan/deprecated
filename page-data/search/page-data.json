React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won’t work!\n\n## Event Handlers\n\nYou can respond to events by declaring event handler functions inside your components:\n\n```tsx\nfunction MyButton() {\n  function handleClick() {\n    alert('You clicked me!');\n  }\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>;\n}\n```\n\nNotice how `onClick={handleClick}` has no parentheses at the end! Do not call the event handler function: you only need to pass it down. React will call your event handler when the user clicks the button.\n\n## State\n\nOften, you’ll want your component to “remember” some information and display it. For example, maybe you want to count the number of times a button is clicked. To do this, add state to your component.\n\nFirst, we need to import `useState` from `react`:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n```\n\nNow you can declare a state variable inside your component:\n\n```tsx\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n```\n\nYou will get two things from `useState`: the current state (`count`), and the function that lets you update it (`setCount`). You can give them any names, but the convention is to call them like `[something, setSomething]`.\n\nThe first time the button is displayed, count will be 0 because you passed 0 to `useState()`. When you want to change state, call `setCount()` and pass the new value to it. Clicking this button will increment the counter:\n\n```tsx\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>'You clicked me: {count} times </button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nLet's look at the update `Button` component:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Button() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}>'You clicked me: {count} times </button>;\n}\n```\n\n- notice the `const` keyword while using the state\n- notice there's another function called `handleClick` inside of `Button`.\n- notice that we don't do this: `count = count + 1`, we just tell what to do with `count` and let `setCount` do the rest: `setCount(count + 1)`.\n\nYou can use the `Button` component as many times as you want and each `Button` will come with its own counter:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}> You clicked me {count} times! </button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button />\n      <Button />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nEach button “remembers” its own count state and doesn’t affect other buttons.\n\n## Hooks\n\nFunctions starting with `use` are called `Hooks`. `useState` is a built-in Hook provided by React. You can find other built-in Hooks in the [React API reference](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react). You can also write your own Hooks by combining the existing ones.\n\nHooks are more restrictive than regular functions. You can only call Hooks at the top level of your components (or other Hooks). If you want to use useState in a condition or a loop, extract a new component and put it there.\n\nIn the previous example, each `Button` had its own independent count, and when each button was clicked, only the count for the button clicked changed:\n\n![](sharing_data_child.webp)\n\nHowever, often you’ll need components to share data and always update together.\n\nTo make both `Button` components display the same count and update together, you need to move the state from the individual buttons “upwards” to the closest component containing all of them. In our example, this closest component is `App`:\n\n![](sharing_data_parent_clicked.webp)\n\nNow when you click either button, the count in `App` will change, which will change both of the counts in `Button`. Here’s how you can express this in code.\n\n1. Here is what we had:\n\n```tsx\nimport { useState } from 'react';\nimport React from 'react';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction Button() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}> You clicked me {count} times! </button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button />\n      <Button />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n2. We need to move the state \"up\" to `App`:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Button() {\n  return <button onClick={handleClick}> You clicked me {count} times! </button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button />\n      <Button />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\n3. Next, we need to pass the `count` and `setCount` state variables to the `Button` component. This is done just like how you'd pass a variable to a component. You also need to change the signature for `Button` component to accept `count` and `setCount`. The information you pass down like this is called `props`. `App` component contains the `count` state and the `handleClick` event handler, and passes both of them down as props to each of the buttons.\n\n```tsx\nfunction Button({ count, onClick }: any) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}> You clicked me {count} times! </button>;\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n      <Button count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n```\n\nLet's look at the `Button` component:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Button({ count, onClick }: any) {\n  return <button onClick={onClick}> You clicked me {count} times! </button>;\n}\n```\n\n- it is accepting variables: `{count, onClick}` of type `any`\n- the button onClick calls the function passed in which is also called `onClick`.\n- value of `count` is displayed as text in the button\n\nFrom `App`:\n\n```tsx\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count + 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n      <Button count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n- We initialize the state like before using `useState` and declare a `handleClick` function that updates the state\n- We call `Button` with the state value and state updater function\n\nWhen you click the button, the `onClick` handler fires. Each button’s `onClick` prop was set to the `handleClick` function inside `App`, so the code inside of it runs. That code calls `setCount(count + 1)`, incrementing the `count` state variable. The new count value is passed as a prop to each button, so they all show the new value.\n\nThis is called “lifting state up”. By moving state up, we’ve shared it between components.\n\nWith the above in place, your buttons will both reflect the updated value as you click on any button. I made mine a little fun where we start off from 10 and each click reduces the number. While the number > 0, we're healthy and at 0, we alert happy new year! `App` component stays the same:\n\n```tsx\nfunction Button({ count, onClick }: any) {\n  return (\n    <button onClick={onClick}>\n      Remaining: {count > 0 ? count : '0'} {count > 0 ? 'old year' : 'happy new year!'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(10);\n\n  function handleClick() {\n    setCount(count - 1);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <p>Learn React</p>\n      <Button count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n      <Button count={count} onClick={handleClick} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n## Let's Implement\n\nLet's create this:\n\n![](implement.png)\n\nThere are five components on this screen:\n\n![](implement2.png)\n\nHere's their hierarchy:\n\n- FilterableProductTable\n\n  - SearchBar\n\n  - ProductTable\n\n    - Product Category Row\n\n    - Product Row\n\nLet's assume this is the data that our API has returned:\n\n```tsx\n[\n  { category: 'Fruits', price: '$1', stocked: true, name: 'Apple' },\n  { category: 'Fruits', price: '$1', stocked: true, name: 'Dragonfruit' },\n  { category: 'Fruits', price: '$2', stocked: false, name: 'Passionfruit' },\n  { category: 'Vegetables', price: '$2', stocked: true, name: 'Spinach' },\n  { category: 'Vegetables', price: '$4', stocked: false, name: 'Pumpkin' },\n  { category: 'Vegetables', price: '$1', stocked: true, name: 'Peas' },\n];\n```\n","excerpt":"Component Let's create our first component: A few things to note above: We have default component that's exported from this file called  We…","fields":{"slug":"/React/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"Feb 23, 2023","title":"React","tags":["react"],"update":"Jan 01, 0001"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"\n## Intro\n\nWe'll look at a few different \"types\" of networks present.\n\nThere's local networking that deals with how data moves between devices on your local network.\n\nThere's routing: how data moves from your network to another network (AWS, Netflix etc)\n\nWe'll look at how data is actually transmitted from one point to another (segmenting, ports and sessions).\n\n## OSI 7-Layer Model\n\nTo understand networks, we'll go through a conceptual model that is a stack of all the components that make networking possible. This model is called the OSI 7-Layer model:\n\n![OSI-Model](OSI-7-layers.jpeg)\n\nEach \"device\" capable of communicating with networks (ie connected to the internet!) will have a networking stack. Layers 1, 2 and 3 are called the media layers and the remaining are called host layers. Media layer is responsible for helping data move from point A to point B. Hosts layers are responsible for determining how data is chopped up and re-assembled.\n\nConceptually, data is sent from layer 7 of once machine (for example your browser), flows all the way down to layer 1 and back up to layer 7 on another machine (youtube server you're watching that video from!).\n\n## Layer 1 - Physical\n\nThis layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. You can think of this as a setup where 2 machines are connected via a cable or WIFI that communicate directly with each other.\n\n![layer-1](layer_1.png)\n\nAt this layer, the two connected machines agree on a standard where a certain voltage means Binary 1 and another means Binary 0. This allows the two connected machines to transmit data between each other.\n\n### Hub\n\nWhat if we want to add more machines to our system? Not just 2? We can use a layer 1 device called a 4 port hub (to connect 4 machines) to connect 4 machines with each other. The job of a hub is simple: anything received by the hub on any port is transmitted on every other port (including errors and collisions!). See issues here?\n\n- All data is processed by all devices (you can't direct data to a specific port/machine)\n- No way to prevent multiple devices from transmitting at once. So if 2 devices transmit at once, it will cause a collision. Also layer 1 cannot detect when a collision occurs. It lacks any intelligence.\n- No way to control which devices can transmit data\n\n## Layer 2 - Data Link Layer\n\nWe saw the limitations of layer 1 (no device to device communication, no collision avoidance, no transmission control) due to which we need layer 2. Layer 2 requires a functioning layer 1. Assume that for our example, layer 1 is running on ethernet.\n\n![layer-2](layer_2.png)\n\nLayer 2 sends information over a network using a concept called **frames**.\n\nDevices also have a unique hardware address called a **MAC address** for every device on a network. Addresses look like this: `3e:22:fb:b9:5b:75`. MAC address is attached to a specific piece of hardware.\n\nA MAC address consists of 2 parts, an OUI (organizationally unique identifier) which distinguishes one company from another. The other part is network interface controller (or NIC). This means MAC + NIC should result in a globally unique MAC address.\n\nKeep in mind that layer 1 doesn't understand frames or mac addresses. All it does is that it receives the data from layer 2, transmits it across to another device listening on layer 1, and then the data is moved on up to layer 2 of the receiver.\n\n### Frame\n\nA frame is composed of many parts:\n\n![frame](frame.png)\n\nThe first part is the preamble and start frame delimiter (SFD). It allows devices to know that this is the start of the frame. Preamble is 56 bits or 7 bytes (8 bits per byte) and SFD is 8 bits or 1 byte. A layer 2 receiver needs to know where the start of a frame is to make sense of the information contained within it.\n\nNext is the destination and source mac addresses. If you want to send to all devices on the local network, you put all Fs for destination aka broadcast. The source MAC address allows the sender to receive replies.\n\nNext is ether type (or type) that helps determine what layer 3 protocol is putting its data inside the frame. That's because layer 3 builds on top of layer 2 and uses layer 2 for device to device communication on a local network. When the receiver receives data, it needs to know the layer 3 protocol that put data into that frame.\n\nDestination MAC address, source MAC address and type are referred to as MAC header\n\nAfter the header, we have the payload which can range from 46 to 1500 bytes. This contains the data that the frame is sending which is generally provided by layer 3.\n\nAt the end there's the frame check sequence that is used to identify any errors in the frame. It allows the destination to check whether any corruption has occurred or not.\n\n### Layer 2 Complete Flow\n\nLet's checkout a complete flow:\n\n![recap](recap.png)[Credit: learn.cantrill.io](learn.cantrill.io)\n\nSay the machine on the left, let's call it L, needs to send data to machine on the right, R. L knows MAC address of R. L interacts with layer 2 software saying that it needs to send data to R via an ethernet. Data to be transmitted is stored in the payload part of the frame. Layer 2 can communicate with layer 1 the networking stack and it can look for the signs of a \"carrier\" signal. Layer 2 is looking to \"sense\" a carrier. A carrier signal means that there's already data in the signal and we don't want to corrupt existing data. This is the job of CSMA (carrier sense multiple access). If a carrier isn't detected, the frame is passed on to layer 1. This comes in handy in the scenario where R layer 2 is also trying to send data while L is transmitting. Detection of carrier signal will prompt R to wait until it gets the all clear.\n\nWhat if there was no carrier detected and both layer 2s transmitted data? Layer 2 contains collision detection. This is the job of collision detection where a jam signal is sent out by all devices that detected a collision. Then a random backoff occurs. This is random as it will allow a device at random to start transmitting again.\n\nLayer 1 doesn't understand what the frame is. It just receives the data from layer 2 and transmits it across. R side receives the data and passes it up to its layer 2. R layer 2 reviews destination mac address of the frame and passes it to R machine.\n\n![recap2](recap-2.png)[Credit: learn.cantrill.io](learn.cantrill.io)\n\nIn this approach we've encapsulated data into frames for transmission!\n\n### Switch\n\nNow remember our example from earlier in layer 1 where we had a hub that connected 4 devices? To do the same at layer 2, we use something called a switch! Hub was a layer 1 device and had layer 1 limitations. Switch is a layer 2 device and holds a great advantage over hubs! Let's say we have a machine at 12 O'clock (A) transmitting to machine at 3 O'Clock (B):\n\nBecause our devices are layer 2, each machine has its own mac address. Since a switch is a layer 2 device, it understands layer 2 mechanisms. Since each device on our network has a unique address, we need to keep track of those addresses. To do so, our switch keeps track of these addresses using something called a **mac address table (MAT)**. As switches receive traffic, they populate the MAT.\n\n![switch](switch-2.png)[Credit: learn.cantrill.io](learn.cantrill.io)\n\nNow let's assume that the MAT is populated and A needs to send data to B. It creates the frame and sends it over to the switch via layer 1. Switch sees the frame arrive at the port to which A is connected to. At this point 1 of 2 things will happen:\n\n- If switch didn't know which port the destination MAC address was on, it will forward this frame to all the ports\n- If switch does know which port the destination MAC address is attached to, it will use that one port to forward the frame\n\nSwitches also do not forward collisions therefore reducing the scope of collisions.\n\n![switch-2](switch-3.png)[Credit: learn.cantrill.io](learn.cantrill.io)\n\n## Binary to Decimal\n\nAt times, we'll have to convert IPv4 addresses from decimal to binary. Here's an IPv4 address: `133.33.33.7`. Each value between the dot is 8 bytes which means this is a 32 bit number. Converting this to binary should be easy! We'll use this table to perform our conversion:\n\n![decimal-to-binary](decimal-binary.png)\n\nLet's start from left to right in both the table and with our IPv4 address. So:\n\n- pick 133 and keep going down the table until you find the largest value that's <= 133\n- look at the table above and notice that 128 < 133, so put a 1 in that position. Now we're left with 5 (133 - 28 = 5)\n- Keep moving down the table until you get to largest number that's <= 5 which is 4. Put a 1 in that position. Now we're left with 1 (5 - 4 = 1)\n- Keep going down and put a 1 at position 8.\n- All untouched positions will have a 0:\n\n`10000101`\n\n## Layer 3\n\nLayer 3 requires layers 2 and 1. Layer 3's job is to get data from one location (for example a server hosting a video) to another (your laptop). So far we've talked about how machines on the same local area network talk to each other. But what about communication between 2 LANs? Layer 3 is the common protocol that helps communication between multiple layer 2 networks.\n\nLayer 3 adds the internet protocol, or IP, to layer 2. This allows for cross-network (across LANs) IP addressing and routing to move data without direct point-to-point (P2P) links. IP \"packets\" are moved step by step from source to destination via intermediate networks while encapsulated in different frames along the way.\n\nDevices that move packets across networks are called routers. They remove frame encapsulation and add new frame encapsulation at every hop.\n\n### Packets\n\nSimilar to frames, packets encapsulate data that needs to be moved from one machine to another. The difference with packets is that unlike frames, packets can be transferred from destinations not in the same LAN as the source. Packets are placed inside frames where a frame is specific to the local network through which our packet is moving. The frame changes every time packet moves to a new network. The packet remains unchanged (in most cases).\n\n### Packet Structure\n\nPackets can be of 2 types: v4 or v6. For our use-case, we'll focus on a few important fields within a packet (anything not in blue):\n\n![v4-v6](v4-v6.png)\n\n- Source/Destination IP address\n- Time to live or Hop limit (number of hops before the packet \"expires\"). This is to prevent infinite forwarding\n- Protocol: Layer 4 protocol used (TCP, UDP, ICMP)\n\nNotice for v6, we have a larger address field.\n","excerpt":"Intro We'll look at a few different \"types\" of networks present.

The science of encrypting and decrypting information is called cryptography.\n\n**Unencrypted** data is **plaintext** (could be text, image, document etc)\n\n**Encrypted** data is **ciphertext** (could be text, image, document etc)\n\n**Encryption key** is similar to a password that is used to generate ciphertext\n\n**Algorithm** takes plaintext and an encryption key to create ciphertext. There are many algorithms that do this: AES, Blowfish, RC4 etc\n\nThe formulas used to encode and decode messages are called encryption algorithms, or ciphers. Process of encryption takes plaintext and a key and uses an algorithm to generate ciphertext. Decryption is the process of taking ciphertext and key to create plaintext.\n\n## Encryption at rest\n\nEncryption at rest is a type of encryption designed to prevent theft of sensitive data. This type of encryption is usually applied on hard-drives, cloud environment hardware etc. A \"secret\" is used to encrypt and decrypt the data. The secret is not to be shared with others. Only those that have knowledge of the secret would be able to decrypt the data\n\nUsually with this type of encryption, only a single party is involved that is responsible for encryption and decryption of the data.\n\n## Encryption in transit\n\nIn this type of encryption, data is encrypted as it is transferred between two parties. Party A (you) encrypt the data and send it to party B (your bank). Party B decrypts the data, performs some action, encrypts new data and returns this new data back to party A.\n\nThis type of encryption involves multiple systems or users.\n\n## Symmetric key encryption\n\n![symmetric](symmetric.jpeg)\n\nSay you have sender and receiver who want to exchange ciphertext with each other. They do the following:\n\n- Agree on an algorithm (AES-256 for example)\n- The sender takes plaintext and a symmetric encryption key and feeds it to AES-256 algorithm\n- Algorithm outputs ciphertext\n- Ciphertext is then transferred over to receiver\n- **The receiver needs to have the same key that was used to encrypt the data!**\n\nHow do we transfer the key that was used to encrypt the data?! This is why symmetric encryption is not ideal for encryption in transit. It is better suited for encrypting local data (hard drives, cloud servers etc). But just to complete the example above:\n\n- Receiver decrypts the ciphertext using the encryption key that was used\n\n## Asymmetric key encryption\n\n![asymmetric](asymmetric.webp)\n\nSay you have sender and receiver who want to exchange ciphertext with each other. They do the following:\n\n- Agree on an algorithm (public-key encryption or digital signatures for example)\n- The sender takes plaintext and creates asymmetric keys (notice plural!) for that algorithm. Asymmetric encryption uses 2 keys: a public key and a private key.\n- The public key is used to generate the ciphertext and this ciphertext is only decryptable by the private key! Public key cannot decrypt data that it was used to encrypt. The public key is made publicly available\n- The sender downloads the public key made available by the receiver. The sender then uses the public key to create ciphertext and transmit it to the receiver\n- The receiver already has the private key. Receiver provides the private key and cipher text to the algorithm and is able to read plaintext data.\n\nNotice in the flow above, no sensitive key exchange is required! Public key can be used by anyone to create ciphertext and send it to the receiver. But the receiver is the only person who has the private key and is able to decrypt the data.\n\nThis type of encryption is used when two or more parties are involved. This used by SSL or TLS encryption (browser communication) and SSH for example.\n\nAsymmetric encryption is computationally expensive so usually asymmetric encryption is used to exchange symmetric keys and then use symmetric encryption for further communication!\n\n## Signing\n\nSay the receiver has received the message and wants to respond with that confirmation via asymmetric encryption.One option is that the receiver can send an OK message. However, in asymmetric encryption, anyone can get sender's public key and use that to respond with an OK. Receiver can't be sure that the OK was from the intended receiver. This is where signing comes in.\n\nWith signing, the receiver can use their private key and sign that message. The receiver gets the message and it can then use the sender's public key to prove whether that message was signed by the intended receiver.\n\n![signing](signing.png)[Credit: learn.cantrill.io]\n\nKey signing is used for ID verification.\n","excerpt":"Intro Encryption is the method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning.

This user has unrestricted access to all resources in that account. If this account gets hacked, this account will be at the mercy of the hacker. The root user cannot be restricted. We want to be able to provide access to others that isn't without restrictions: for example, the BI department might need access to AWS QuickSight but not to AWS S3. This process of providing only required access is called Least Privileged Access. This is where IAM comes handy!\n\n## [IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html)\n\nIAM:\n\n- Is a global service that is globally resilient service. All data is replicated across all regions\n- Manages identities since it is an identity provider or **IDP**\n- Provides **authentication** (who is signed in?): I am who I say I am!\n- Provides **authorization** (who has permissions?) for AWS services. A service evaluates if an AWS request is allowed or denied. Access is denied by default and is allowed only when a policy explicitly grants access.\n\n## IAM Entities\n\n![users-groups-roles](users_groups_roles.png)\n\nUsing IAM, you can create IAM Users, IAM Groups and IAM Roles. Each have their own specific use-case:\n\n### IAM Users\n\nThe \"identity\" aspect of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) helps you with the question \"Who is that user?\", often referred to as authentication. Users are identities which represent humans that need access to your account. IAM users are not separate accounts; they are users within your account. Each user can have its own password for access to the AWS Management Console.\n\nIAM users are granted long term credentials to your AWS resources. As a best practice, you should require your human users to use temporary credentials when accessing AWS. You can use an identity provider for your human users to provide federated access to AWS accounts by assuming roles, which provide temporary credentials.\n\n### IAM Groups\n\nGroups are simply collections of related users. This is useful when you need to provide access to users who have similar roles in an org. For example, QuickSight access for all BAs in your BI group.\n\n### IAM Roles\n\nRoles help us provide permissions to:\n\n- AWS services to perform actions on our behalf. For example lambda in our account writing to S3 bucket in our account.\n- External services to our account. For example lambda in another account writing to S3 bucket in our account.\n\n### Best Practice\n\nAs a [best practice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html), require human users to use federation with an identity provider to access AWS using temporary credentials. An additional best practice recommendation is to require workloads to use temporary credentials with IAM roles to access AWS. IAM users are to be used only in very limited scenarios where an IAM role cannot be assumed.\n\n## IAM Policies\n\nHow does IAM actually \"attach\" these permissions to the entities listed above?

It is designed for the development of large applications and transpiles to JavaScript.\n\n## Compiler\n\nLet's start at the compiler: programs are files that contain a bunch of text written by you, the programmer. That text is parsed by a special program called a compiler, which trans‐ forms it into an abstract syntax tree (AST), a data structure that ignores things like whitespace, comments, and where you stand on the tabs versus spaces debate. After the TypeScript Compiler generates an AST for your program—but before it emits code—it typechecks your code. The compiler then converts that AST to a lower-level representation called bytecode. You can feed that bytecode into another program called a runtime to evaluate it and get a result. So when you run a program, what you’re really doing is telling the runtime to evaluate the bytecode generated by the compiler from the AST parsed from your source code.\n\nWhere TypeScript is special is that instead of compiling straight to bytecode, TS compiles to JavaScript code. You then run that JavaScript code like you normally would—in your browser, or with NodeJS.\n\nThis typechecking is the magic behind TypeScript. It’s how TypeScript makes sure that your program works as you expect, that there aren’t obvious mistakes.\n\n## The Type System\n\nTo explicitly signal to TypeScript what your types are, use annotations. Annotations take the form value: type and tell the typechecker, “Hey! You see this value here? Its type is type.” Let’s look at a few examples (the comments following each line are the actual types inferred by TypeScript):\n\n```tsx\nlet a: number = 1; // a is a number\nlet b: string = 'hello'; // b is a string\nlet c: boolean[] = [true, false]; // c is an array of booleans\n```\n\nAnd if you want TypeScript to infer your types for you, just leave them off and let TypeScript get to work:\n\n```tsx\nlet a = 1; // a is a number\nlet b = 'hello'; // b is a string\nlet c = [true, false]; // c is an array of booleans\n```\n\nTypeScript is a gradually typed language. That means that TypeScript works best when it knows the types of everything in your program at compile time, but it doesn’t have to know every type in order to compile your program. Even in an untyped program, TypeScript can infer some types for you and catch some mistakes, but without knowing the types for everything, it will let a lot of mistakes slip through to your users. TypeScript statically analyzes your code for errors, and shows them to you before you run it.\n\n## tsconfig.json\n\nEvery TypeScript project should include a file called `tsconfig.json` in its root directory. This tsconfig.json is where TypeScript projects define things like which files should be compiled, which directory to compile them to, and which version of JavaScript to emit.\n\n```ts\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    //Which APIs should TSC assume exist in the environment you’ll be running your code in? This includes things like ES5’sFunction.prototype.bind, ES2015’sObject.assign, and the DOM’s document.querySelector.\n    \"lib\": [\"es2015\"],\n    // Which module system should TSC compile your code to (CommonJS, SystemJS, ES2015, etc.)?\n    \"module\": \"commonjs\",\n    // Which folder should TSC put your generated JavaScript code in?\n    \"outDir\": \"dist\",\n    \"sourceMap\": true,\n    //Be as strict as possible when checking for invalid code. This option enforces that all of your code is properly typed. We’ll be using it for all of the examples in the book, and you should use it for your TypeScript project too.\n    \"strict\": true,\n    //Which JavaScript version should TSC compile your code to (ES3, ES5, ES2015, ES2016, etc.)?\n    \"target\": \"es2015\"\n  },\n  //# Which folders should TSC look in to find your TypeScript files?\n  \"include\": [\"src\"]\n}\n```\n\n## tslint.json\n\nYour project should also have a `tslint.json` file containing your TSLint configuration, codifying whatever stylistic conventions you want for your code (tabs versus spaces, etc.).\n\nThe following command will generate a tslint.json file with a default TSLint configuration:\n\n```bash\n./node_modules/.bin/tslint --init\n```\n\nYou can then add overrides to this to conform with your own coding style. For example, my tslint.json looks like this:\n\n```tsx\n{\n  \"defaultSeverity\": \"error\",\n  \"extends\": [\n      \"tslint:recommended\"\n  ],\n  \"rules\": {\n    \"semicolon\": false,\n    \"trailing-comma\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## index.ts\n\nNow that you’ve set up your tsconfig.json and tslint.json, create a src folder containing your first TypeScript file:\n\n```bash\nmkdir src\ntouch src/index.ts\n```\n\nYour project’s folder structure should now look this:\n\n```text\n    chapter-2/\n    ├──node_modules/\n    ├──src/\n    │ └──index.ts\n    ├──package.json\n    ├──tsconfig.json\n    └──tslint.json\n```\n\nPop open src/index.ts in your code editor, and enter the following TypeScript code:\n\n```tsx\nconsole.log('Hello TypeScript!');\n```\n\nThen, compile and run your TypeScript code:\n\n```tsx\n# Compile your TypeScript with TSC\n./node_modules/.bin/tsc\n# Run your code with NodeJS\nnode ./dist/index.js\n```\n\nThis will print `Hello Typescript` in your terminal! With `ts-node` installed, you can simply do this:\n\n```bash\nts-node index.ts\n```\n\n## Types\n\nOfficially a type is set of values and the things you can do with them. For example:\n\n• The boolean type is the set of all booleans (there are just two: true and false)\nand the operations you can perform on them (like ||, &&, and !).\n\n• The number type is the set of all numbers and the operations you can perform on them (like +, -, \\*, /, %, ||, &&, and ?), including the methods you can call on them like .toFixed, .toPrecision, .toString, and so on.\n\n• The string type is the set of all strings and the operations you can perform on them (like +, ||, and &&), including the methods you can call on them like .concat and .toUpperCase.\n\nWhen you see that something is of type T, not only do you know that it’s a T, but you also know exactly what you can do with that T (and what you can’t). Remember, the whole point is to use the typechecker to stop you from doing invalid things. And the way the typechecker knows what’s valid and what’s not is by looking at the types you’re using and how you’re using them.\n\nYou can also define your own type:\n\n```tsx\ntype Programmer = {\n  /**\n   * The full name of the Programmer\n   */\n  name: string;\n  /**\n   * This Programmer is known for what?\n   */\n  knownFor: string[];\n};\n\nconst ada: Programmer = {\n  name: 'Ada Lovelace',\n  knownFor: ['Mathematics', 'Computing', 'First Programmer'],\n};\n```\n\nComments you see above are docstring comments.\n\nHere's what typescript's type hierarchy looks like:\n\n![](type-hierarchy.png)\n\nSay you have a function that takes some value and returns that value multiplied by itself:\n\n```tsx\nfunction squareOf(n) {\n  return n * n;\n}\n// squareOf(2) evaluates to 4\n// squareOf('z') evaluates to NaN\n```\n\nClearly, this function will only work for numbers—if you pass anything besides a number to squareOf, the result will be invalid. So what we do is explicitly annotate the parameter’s type:\n\n```tsx\nfunction squareOf(n: number) {\n  return n * n;\n}\n```\n\nWe can say the following things about the last code example:\n\n1. squareOf’s parameter n is constrained to number.\n\n2. The type of the value 2 is assignable to (equivalently: compatible with) number.\n\nWithout a type annotation, squareOf is unconstrained in its parameter, and you can pass any type of argument to it. Once we constrain it, TypeScript goes to work for us verifying that every place we call our function, we call it with a compatible argument.\n\n### any\n\nany is the Godfather of types. It does anything for a price, but you don’t want to ask any for a favor unless you’re completely out of options. In TypeScript everything needs to have a type at compile time, and any is the default type when you (the pro‐ grammer) and TypeScript (the typechecker) can’t figure out what type something is. It’s a last resort type, and you should avoid it when possible. any is the set of all values, and you can do anything with any. That means that if you have a value of type any you can add to it, multiply by it, call .pizza() on it—anything.\n\n```tsx\nlet a: any = 666; // any\nlet b: any = ['danger']; // any\nlet c = a + b; // any\n```\n\nUsing any in the above, no errors are thrown! My compiler returned this:\n\n```tsx\n666danger\n```\n\n### unknown\n\nFor the few cases where you have a value whose type you really don’t know ahead of time, don’t use any, and instead reach for unknown. Like any, it represents any value, but TypeScript won’t let you use an unknown type until you refine it by checking what it is. (more on refinement later)\n\n### boolean\n\n```tsx\nleta = true;\nvar b = false;\nconst c = true;\nlet d: boolean = true;\nlet e: true = true;\nlet f: true = false; // Error TS2322: Type 'false' is not assignable to type 'true'.\n```\n\n`e` isn’t just any old boolean—it’s the specific boolean true. By using a value as a type, we essentially limited the possible values for `e` and `f` from all booleans to one specific boolean each. This feature is called **type literals**.\n\n**type literal** : A type that represents a single value and nothing else\n\n### number\n\nnumber is the set of all numbers: integers, floats, positives, negatives, Infinity, NaN, and so on. Numbers can do, well, numbery things, like addition (+), subtraction (-), modulo (%), and comparison (<).Example:\n\n```tsx\nlet a = 1234;\nvar b = Infinity * 0.1;\nconst c = 5678;\nlet d = a < b; //bool\nlet e: number = 100;\nlet f: 26.218 = 26.218; // 26.218\nf = 27; // Type '27' is not assignable to type '26.218'\nlet g: 26.218 = 10; // Error TS2322: Type '10' is not assignable to type '26.218'.\n```\n\n### objects\n\nTypeScript’s object types specify the shapes of objects. If you try this:\n\n```tsx\nlet a: object = { b: 'x' };\n```\n\nyou'll get an error saying: `Property 'b' does not exist on type 'object'`. Wait, that’s not very useful! What’s the point of typing something as an object if you can’t do anything with it? `object` is a little narrower than any, but not by much. object doesn’t tell you a lot about the value it describes, just that the value is a JavaScript object (and that it’s not null).\n\nYou can do 2 things:\n\n- Leave off the `object`:\n\n```tsx\nlet a = { b: 'x' };\n```\n\n- Explicitly provide type for `b`:\n\n```tsx\nlet a: { b: string } = {\n  b: 'hello!',\n};\nconsole.log(a.b);\n```\n\nThis is called `object literal` syntax. Object literal syntax says, “Here is a thing that has this shape.” The thing might be an object literal, or it might be a class:\n\n```tsx\nlet a: { firstName: string; lastName: string } = {\n  firstName: 'john',\n  lastName: 'barrowman',\n};\nclass Person {\n  constructor(public firstName: string, public lastName: string) {}\n}\na = new Person('matt', 'smith'); // OK\n```\n\n`{firstName: string, lastName: string}` describes the shape of an object, and both the object literal and the class instance from the last example satisfy that shape, so TypeScript lets us assign a Person to `a`.\n\nCan you tell TypeScript that something is optional, or that there might be more properties than you planned for? You bet:\n\n```tsx\nlet a: {\n  b: number; // 1\n  c?: string; // 2\n  [key: number]: boolean; // 3\n};\n```\n\n`a`:\n\n1. has property `b` that is a number\n\n2. might have a property `c` that is string that is optional. And if `c` exists, it might be undefined\n\n3. might have any number of numeric properties that are booleans. This too is optional\n\nExample:\n\n```tsx\na = { b: 1, c: undefined, 10: true, 20: false, 30: true };\na = { b: 1, c: undefined };\na = { b: 1, c: 'd' };\na = { b: 1, 10: true };\na = { b: 1, 10: true, 20: false };\n```\n\nThe `[key: T]: U` syntax is called an **index signature**, and this is the way you tell TypeScript that the given object might contain more keys. The way to read it is, “For this object, all keys of type T must have values of type U.” Index signatures let you safely add more keys to an object, in addition to any keys that you explicitly declared. What this means is that for `a`, if you have a number on the left, then it must have a boolean assigned:\n\n```tsx\n// not ok:\nlet a: {\n  b: number;\n  c?: string;\n  2: string; // <-- NO!\n  [key: number]: boolean;\n};\n```\n\nError for above will be: `Property '2' of type 'string' is not assignable to 'number' index type 'boolean'.ts(2411)`\n\n```tsx\n// this is ok:\nlet a: {\n  b: number;\n  c?: string;\n  2: boolean;\n  5: boolean;\n  [key: number]: boolean;\n};\n\na = { b: 1, c: undefined, 10: true, 20: false, 2: true, 5: false };\n```\n\nThere is one rule to keep in mind for index signatures: the index signature key’s type, T, must be assignable to either number or string.
